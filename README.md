# SecureFileXfer

Python-based tool for encrypted and secure file transfers over the internet.



## Features
- **File Encryption**: Leverage state-of-the-art encryption algorithms for security.
- **Secure Transmission**: Aims to provide SSL/TLS-based transmission for added security (Future Release).
- **Integrity Assurance**: Planning to implement a hash check for data integrity.
- **User Authentication**: In the roadmap to add password or cryptographic key-based authentication.

## How to Use

1. **Generate Encryption Key**:
    ```python
    key = generate_key()
    print(f"Generated Key: {key}")
    ```

2. **Encrypt Your Content**:
    ```python
    original_content = "Your Secret Message Here"
    encrypted = encrypt_file_content(original_content, key)
    print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")
    ```

3. **Decrypt The Content**:
    ```python
    decrypted = decrypt_file_content(encrypted, key)
    print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")
    ```
